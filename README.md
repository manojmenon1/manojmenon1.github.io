### ML/AI Projects
**INN Hotels:** Reduced revenue loss due to hotel room booking cancellations. Analyzed INN Hotels booking data to identify key factors driving cancellations, built predictive models to forecast hotel room cancellations in advance, and provided insights to support profitable policies for refunds and cancellations.
**Github Code base:** https://manojmenon1.github.io/Hotel-Room-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-Modeling/

**Key skills used:** Performed EDA and data preprocessing, built and refined logistic regression models (Statsmodels) by addressing multicollinearity and removing insignificant variables, and interpreted results using coefficients. Developed decision tree models (scikit-learn), evaluated performance, and delivered business insights to improve profitability.

**Trade Ahead:** Analyzed the stocks data, grouped the stocks based on the attributes provided, and shared insights about the characteristics of each group.

**Key skills used:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and applied unsupervised learning techniques with scikit-learn, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Cluster Profiling, to uncover hidden patterns and business insights.

**ReneWind:** "ReneWind" is a green energy company that harnesses wind energy. Developed and tuned machine learning classification models on sensor data from wind turbines to predict generator failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing overall repair costs

**Key skills used:** Applied up/down sampling, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning to build six classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting). Selected the top three models, evaluated performance, and delivered business insights and actionable conclusions.

**EasyVisa:** Analyzed visa applicant data and built predictive models to identify key factors influencing approval outcomes, enabling data-driven recommendations on applicant profiles for certification or denial.

**Key skills used:** Performed EDA and data preprocessing, built multiple classification models (Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), and improved performance through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. Compared results, identified key features, and delivered business insights with actionable recommendations.

**Mortgage Default Prediction:** Analyzed multi-year anonymized mortgage repayment data (millions of records) to build predictive models for borrower default risk, leveraging loan details, demographics, property attributes, and payment history to generate actionable insights.

**Key skills used:** Performed EDA and built multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Ensemble methods), applying hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Evaluated models using ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy, and deployed the best-performing model.

**Streamlining Auto Vehicle Pricing through MLOps:** Designed and implemented an MLOps pipeline using MLflow that automated the pricing workflow. This pipeline encompasses data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, model building, training, evaluation, and registration with CI/CD capabilities to ensure continuous integration and delivery.

**Key Skills Used:** Built an end-to-end MLOps Pipeline in AzureML Studio, created a Github actions workflow with necessary Python scripts and YAML files, executed the workflow and validated the CICD implementation.

**RAG Based Medical Assistant:** Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI solution leveraging medical manuals as a knowledge base to assist healthcare professionals in faster, more accurate diagnoses. Delivered a proof-of-concept system that improved information retrieval efficiency, reduced diagnostic errors, and standardized care practices, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

**Key Skills Used:** Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI solution using Python, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, and FAISS to integrate medical manuals into a knowledge base. Implemented vector search, prompt engineering, and document parsing pipelines for efficient information retrieval.
